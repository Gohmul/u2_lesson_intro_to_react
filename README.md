## Overview

In this lesson, we'll about React! React is a javascript library that gives us the ability to build some awesome single page applications using only javascript. This library allows us to build an interactive UI utilizing a modular component structure. The goal here is to break our code up into re-usable modules that can update our UI in a simple and efficient manner.

## What is React?

From [sharpcorner.com](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/what-and-why-reactjs/)

> React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It’s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React first deployed on Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

> React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

In short, React gives us the ability to rapidly build applications that are highly interactive in a quick and efficient manner. It uses something called the `virtual DOM` which is an abstraction layer over the native browser DOM. By using the the `virtual DOM` to facilitate the communication between our code and the actual DOM, our applications become update lightning fast and are less bug prone!
